Invalid input causes same prompt again in infinite loop until get correct input



1)Program takes size of plateau as two space separate numbers eg "5 5"
	input must be two numbers

2)Program takes initial location for rover as two ints and direction eg "3 3 N"
	input must be two numbers and "N", "S", "E", "W" for direction

3)Program takes input of movement instructions eg : "mmllmmllllmmm"
	no spaces and characters must be "L", "R", "M" . Small caps allowed

4)Rover moves using movement instructions
	"L" rotates left
	"R" rotates right
	"M" moves in current facing direction

5)Return to step 2 for next rover




A 5 by 5 plateau is 0 to 5, so 5 is a valid coordinate in 5 by 5 plateau

Map coordinates are inverted on y, 0 is bottom row , top row is plateau height

If rover goes off edge it wraps around, so go off top wraps to bottom, go off left wraps to right
and visa versa
